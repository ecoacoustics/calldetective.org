      Data platforms such as <a href="https://www.ecosounds.org">Ecosounds</a>
      are powerful tools that include data ingestion, analysis, and annotating
      workflows. However, interacting with citizen scientists through a data
      management platform is a barrier to engagement.

    <p class="md-typescale-body-medium">
      Call detective websites are designed to complement data platforms by
      providing an engaging and user-friendly interface for citizen scientists
      to explore and contribute to ecoacoustics projects.
